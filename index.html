    <p>I'm Lukas Rosenberger, a sixth semester <a href="https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/en/disciplines/design-media-arts/bachelor-multimediatechnology/degree-programme/degree-programme/">MultiMediaTechnology</a> student majoring in Game and Mixed Reality Engineering at <a
            href="http://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/">FH Salzburg</a>. I'm a huge fan of video games and am also currently
        studying Game Studies and Game Design as secondary subject.</p>

        <p>Major League Gladiators is a 2-player co-op shooter in VR. The players take control of two classes, the Tank and the DPS,
            facing off against waves of enemies in a tron-styled arena. Major League Gladiators attempts to use the immersive capabilities of Roomscale VR
            to create action packed combat as well as true cooperation between players. Players will have to attempt to survive as many waves of
            enemies as possible by synergistically using their abilities as well as keeping each other’s health and ammunition up. In Major League Gladiators
            we concentrate on the coop experience. We want the players to really play together.
            They attack together and they support each other. Lone wolves won’t survive!</p>

        <p> This is the final project of my team of five bachelor degree students of MultiMediaTechnology (MMT)
            at University of Applied Sciences Salzburg (FHS). We also cooperated with students from MultiMediaArt (MMA) for our asset creation.
            The project started in January 2017 and was completed in June 2017.</p>

        <p> I took the role of AI developer and Game Designer on the project. My responsibilities included:
        <ul>
            <li><p>Creating intelligent and extendable AI-controlled enemies</p></li>
            <li><p>Closely working with artists to realize their designs in the game</p></li>
            <li><p>Supporting other programmers</p></li>
            <li><p>Creating, evolving and evaluating the game design</p></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p> Major League Gladiators was built using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and currently supports the HTC Vive.
            A release on Steam is currently in the works. We also hope to open source the project in the near future.<br>

        <p> A four player, local multiplayer FPS where players can flip their gravity by 90° in any direction at any time. The game was built
            by two of my colleagues and me during our fourth bachelor semester using Unity.

        <p> Helmet Squishers is a 2D platform fighter for 2 players developed in 2 days for a Game Jam at the FH
            Salzburg under the motto
            'It's not a bug, it's a feature'. The goal of the game is to squish your enemy three times by jumping on
            their head. </p>

        <p> However, you can make your life easier or harder through activating one of the games modifiers:

        <p>

        <ul>
            <li> Flip the games gravity by jumping on an activator pad.</li>
            <li> Kick the enemy into a random direction, also via one of the activator pads.</li>
            <li> Turn of your character light to sneak up to the enemy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Everytime you jump there is also a chance of teleporting to a random position, which could work for (porting
            you away just before getting hit) or against (ruining your perfectly set up squish) you.</p>

        <p>As part of our MMP2a (MultiMediaProject) I and 2 of my fellow students developed a 2D tactical turn-based
            squad fighter called Realtity Ruckus.</p>

        <p>In Reality Ruckus, you are a hero who has been chosen to restore order to time and space following a
            catastrophic
            event which collapsed multiple realites into each other. Along the way you will team up with other heroes to
            face the various different enemies. </p>

        <p>You will have to explore randomly generated areas and face a multitude of foes in order to collect fragments
            of an artifact, which is the only hope to restore order back to space and time. </p>

        <p>Upon finding all artifact fragments in an area, your hero will have to travel to the next dimension, where he
            will have to face new challenges. </p>

        <p>This is the game I made for my second semester multi media project (MMP). It's a basic Scorched Earth clone
            with different weapons and up to 8 player hotseat multiplayer.</p>

        <p>The goal is to shoot the other tanks, taking the ballistic trajectory of the projectiles and the wind into
            account. Using the limited movement and the destructible environment to your advantage will also ensure that
            you will be the last tank standing.</p>

        <p>This game was made during my first semester at FH. It's a clone of a flash game with the same name, the
            difference being that my version was made in JavaScript/WebGL with <a
                    href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>.</p>

        <p>In the game you fly through an endless tunnel, avoiding obstacles and flying through rings to gain speed
            boosts, all while you (and the background music) get continously faster.</p>
