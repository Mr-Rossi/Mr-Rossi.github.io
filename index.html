<p>I'm Lukas Rosenberger, a third semester CompSci Student majoring in Game and Mixed Reality Engineering at <a href="http://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/">FH Salzburg</a>. I'm a huge fan of video games and am also currently pursuing a minor in Game Design.</p>

<a id="reality-ruckus" class="anchor" href="#reality-ruckus" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reality Ruckus</h3>

<p>My current project is a 2D semi turn-based Roguelike called Realtity Ruckus. It is being developed in cooperation with 2 of my fellow students as part of our MMP2a (MultiMediaProject).  </p>

<p>In Reality Ruckus, you are a hero who has been chosen to restore order to time and space following a catastrophic event which collapsed multiple realites into each other. Along the way you will meet fellow heroes who have been forced to leave their dimension.  </p>

<p>You will have to explore randomly generated areas and face a multitude of foes in order to collect fragments of an artifact, which is the only hope to restore order back to space and time.  </p>

<p>Upon finding all artifact fragments in an area, your hero will have to travel to the next dimension, where he will have to face new challenges.  </p>
