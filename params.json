{"name":"Lukas Rosenberger","tagline":"Aspiring Game Designer/Developer","body":"## Who is that guy?\r\nI'm Lukas Rosenberger, a third semester CompSci Student majoring in Game and Mixed Reality Engineering at [FH Salzburg](http://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/). I'm a huge fan of video games and am also currently pursuing a minor in Game Design.\r\n\r\n### Reality Ruckus\r\nMy current project is a 2D semi turn-based Roguelike called Realtity Ruckus. It is being developed in cooperation with 2 of my fellow students as part of our MMP2a (MultiMediaProject).  \r\n\r\nIn Reality Ruckus, you are a hero who has been chosen to restore order to time and space following a catastrophic event which collapsed multiple realites into each other. Along the way you will meet fellow heroes who have been forced to leave their dimension.  \r\n\r\nYou will have to explore randomly generated areas and face a multitude of foes in order to collect fragments of an artifact, which is the only hope to restore order back to space and time.  \r\n\r\nUpon finding all artifact fragments in an area, your hero will have to travel to the next dimension, where he will have to face new challenges.  \r\n\r\n![Reality Ruckus](./img/rr.png)  \r\n_An early development screenshot of Reality Ruckus' Sci-Fi setting_\r\n\r\n### Yet Another Artillery Game\r\nThis is the game I made for my second semester multi media project (MMP).
